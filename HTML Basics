<h3>Code in Text</h3>
  <p>
    we can write <code><b>{color:green;}</b></code> in our css, and it will apply to anything marked up as an &lt;h4&gt; element.
    <b>"& lt;" = &lt;  "& gt;" = &gt;</b> 
  </P>
<h1>Text Formatting</h1>
  <p>
    we are writing some stuff and since its such a long pragraph we dont need to make a million p tags we can just use <b>br</b><br>
    and now we have a new line<br>
    another line<br>
    another<br>
    goodbye.<br>
    You can also use & nbsp; (non breaking space) that will not wrap when used between two words biiiiiiiigggg&nbsp;worrd

  <h2 class="subheadline">Beekeeping</h2>
  <p>Humans have kept honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers.</p>
  <p>Depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them are shown in Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago.<sup class="footnote">[91]</sup> Simple hives and smoke were used; jars of honey were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. From the 18th century, European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony .</p>

  <h3 class="poem-title">Bee An Apple</h3>
  <p class="byline">by Paul Cameron Brown</p>
  <pre class="poem"> 
      The taste of an apple,
        the cringing of a bee
      as sun stops turning
        a ladle over their skins;
      the fire gold stains
        on apple's skin,
      the honey yellow, black bits
        a hornet wrinkles in.
